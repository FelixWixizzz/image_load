## This is web automation using the Selenium library for Python. It automates the process of uploading images on the DeviantArt site

# What is he doing?

### The bot configures browser settings and creates an instance of the Chrome driver. He then opens the DeviantArt site's login page and enters the user's credentials. After that, it begins to upload images from the specified directory to the DeviantArt website. Each image goes through a range of steps, including selecting the image, adding a description and tags, choosing options such as size and tools, and setting a price for paid downloads. The code uses various methods and functions to find elements on the page, interact with them, and handle possible errors. It also includes time delays to wait for elements on the page to load and interact with them.
